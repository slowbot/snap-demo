                  <h2>HDFS & YARN : The core of Hadoop</h2>
                  <p>The core components of HDP are YARN and Hadoop Distributed Filesystem (HDFS). YARN is the architectural center of Hadoop that enables you to process data simultaneously in multiple ways. YARN provides the resource management and pluggable architecture for enabling a wide variety of data access methods. HDFS provides the scalable, fault-tolerant, cost-efficient storage for big data.</p>

                  <h2>Access data from a variety of engines</h2>
                  <p>YARN provides the foundation for a versatile range of processing engines that empower you to interact with the same data in multiple ways, at the same time. This means applications can interact with the data in the best way: from batch to interactive SQL or low latency access with NoSQL. Emerging use cases for data science, search and streaming are also supported with Apache Spark, Solr and Storm. Additionally, ecosystem partners provide even more specialized data access engines for YARN.</p>

                  <p>HDP extends data access and management with powerful tools for data governance and integration. They provide a reliable, repeatable, and simple framework for managing the flow of data in and out of Hadoop. This control structure, along with a set of tooling to ease and automate the application of schema or metadata on sources is critical for successful integration of Hadoop into your modern data architecture.</p>

                  <p>Hortonworks has engineering relationships with all of the data management providers to enable their tools to work and integrate with HDP.</p>

                  <p>Security is woven and integrated into at HDP in multiple layers. Critical features for authentication, authorization, accountability and data protection are in place so that you can secure HDP across these key requirements. Consistent with approach throughout all of the enterprise Hadoop capabilities, HDP also ensures you can integrate and extend your current security solutions to provide a single, consistent, secure umbrella over your modern data architecture.</p>

                  <p>Operations teams deploy, monitor and manage a Hadoop cluster within their broader enterprise data ecosystem. HDP delivers a complete set of operational capabilities that provide both visibilities into the health of your cluster as well as tooling to manage configuration and optimize performance across all data access methods. Apache Ambari provides APIs to integrate with existing management systems: for instance Microsoft System Center and Teradata ViewPoint.</p>
